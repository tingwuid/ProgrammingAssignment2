This is the submission for R Programming assignment 2.

The R file contains 2 functions

makeCacheMatrix function  
This function takes a matrix and creates a list containing the function to
1. set the matrix
2. get the matrix
3. set the inverse of the matrix
4. get the inverse of the matrix

cacheSolve function calculate the inverse of the input matrix.
It will check if the inverse was calculated first. 
If the inverse matrix was calculated already, it shows the message "getting cached data" and returns the cached inverse.
If the inverse matrix has not been calculated, it calculates the inverse of the matrix.
